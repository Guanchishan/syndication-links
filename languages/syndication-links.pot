In order for you to use the syndication feature in this plugin, you need to remove all feeds and replace them with the one below and set your micro.blog username in your WordPress user profile. By default this using the JSONfeed if installed, otherwise RSS. This feed is generated by the same triggers used by the other providers. Please check to make sure the feed is working properly. A few seconds after publishing the plugin will poll micro.blog to get the link."
